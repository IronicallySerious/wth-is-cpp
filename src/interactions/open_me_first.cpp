/*
	This is your playing ground.
	Use code completions to navigate your way around this guide.

	For example, you can begin with writing 'where_am_i' in a single line and try running the program to get some output

	This project allows you to work your way around understanding C++ code. I recommend using code completion because
	a lot of tokens can only be discovered through somewhat sensible guesses.
